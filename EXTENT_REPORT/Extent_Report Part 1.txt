Different log levels of extent report

Extent report of 5th version has total 5 log levels
1) Fail 2) Skip 3) Warning 4) Pass 5) info

But in 4 th version total 8 log levels are available
and these extra log levels are as below
1) Fatal 2) ERROR 3) Debug

But these three levels (Fatal, Error and Debug ) are removed in the 
latest vesersion of Junit so From Extent Report also removed
---------------------------------------------
Q. Why Fatal, Error and Debug log levels removed in 5th version of Extent Report?
Ans: These log levels are remved from Junit and TestNG.

We use Extent report with Junit and TestNG, If Junit and
TestNg are not using these log level then there is no
use for Extent Report.
--------------------------------------------------
When we apply different log levels on same test case then 
final result of test case is depends on priority of Log level
and log level priority is as below

1) Fail 
2) Skip 
3) Warning 
4) Pass 
5) info

Note: If no log level is mentioned then bydefault is considered as pass.
